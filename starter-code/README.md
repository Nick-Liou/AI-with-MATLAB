### Instructions.pdf
This is the guide with detailed steps to help your team use MATLAB Mobile and MATLAB Online to create your fitness tracker. We have also included a simple example that you can use to start with or draw inspiration from as you create your own solution to this challenge!

### GradingRubric.docx
This document provides the grading rubric that judges will be using for the challenge. 

### ExampleModel.mlx 
This is a MATLAB Live Script that compiles the workflows shown in the instructions document into a code example. It shows how to process data acquired from a MATLAB Mobile session in order to make meaningful conclusions, and can be edited and executed in MATLAB or MATLAB Online. In order to run this Live Script, make sure ExampleData.mat, ActivityLogs.mat, and timeElapsed.m are in the same folder. 

### ExampleData.mat 
This is a MATLAB data file containing a set of sensor data previously acquired using the workflow demonstrated in the “Collecting Data” section of the 'Instructions' document.

### ActivityLogs.mat
This is a MATLAB data file containing a set of sensor data previously acquired using the workflow demonstrated in the “Collecting Data” section of the 'Instructions' document.

### timeElapsed.m 
This is a helper MATLAB function used in the example model to transform an array containing the date and time of the data points collected to an array of the time elapsed since the acquisition was started
